```{tab-item} Things I Learned
* In this assignment I learned how to properly format and build a Jupyter book, as well as how useful a Jupyter book can be for compiling reports.
* Learning how to build and publish these books is a great asset in my skillset and will surely be of help to me in my future endeavours.
 
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
* I caused a great deal of trouble for myself in this assignment by not properly checking what I was doing and operating on autopilot, this serves as a lesson to think your actions through before you do them.
* I also had trouble initially sorting through some of the file organization, but was able to get a handle on it relatively quickly.
